## Description:

## Installation

The user can install packages and dependencies by running npm install at the root level. The system will automatically cd into both client and server directories to install the necessary packages. Once dependencies are installed, the user will then enter the command npm run build, followed by the command npm run start:dev to launch the server and then utilize the application.

# Testing:

The user can test the application by entering text into the editor and then using the Chrome DevTools to inspect the page. Here, the user can go into the Application tab to view the created database under IndexedDB as well as the service-worker and the cached storage. The console will also display any errors needing to be resolved to ensure proper application functionality.
Once the text editor is launched in the browser, the user can click the install button and then begin to type any text they desire, starting at line 1. They can then hit enter to save the text at any time and it will persist on the page for future access.
